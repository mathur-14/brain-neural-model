The data in this lab comes from neural recordings described in:

Neurons are the basic information processing units in the brain.  Neurons communicate with one another via *spikes* or *action potentials* which are brief events where voltage in the neuron rapidly rises then falls.  These spikes trigger the electro-chemical signals between one neuron and another.  In this experiment, the spikes were recorded from 196 neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of a monkey using an electrode array implanted onto the surface of a monkey's brain.  During the recording, the monkey performed several reaching tasks and the position and velocity of the hand was recorded as well.  

The goal of the experiment is to try to *read the monkey's brain*:  That is, predict the hand motion from the neural signals from the motor cortex. Being able to make such predictions is the precursor to [technologies like Braingate and Neuralink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRt8QCx3BCo) that use electrode implants to read neural activity that then controls a cursor or robotic arm.
